Lonely frame idea is what? Something interesting, of course, but what else?
I would think that the idea is something that could be taken and put into
some sort of form, but I'm not sure how that's going to be possible, with a
language like clojure?

What are some of the things that I'd need?

* doujin game engine for java
    Preferably something like renpy, since it's pretty damn good at what it
does and isn't afraid to show off?

* real-time game engine for java
    I could use lwjgl, sure, but isn't there some other lib for java that's
basically *meant* for 2D graphics?

* nice graphics
    Really dependant on my gumption at the time, I think.

* good storyline
    See above.

* innovative mechanics
    I'd like to have the stackable equipment metaphor be front-and-center.
The real-timey movement mechanic is a close second.

* etc.
